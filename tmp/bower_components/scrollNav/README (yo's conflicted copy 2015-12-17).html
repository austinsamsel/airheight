It's that easy…well almost.</p> <h3 id=styling>Styling</h3> <p>To keep the plugin simple there are no styles added to the navigation, that's all up to you. The nav structure looks like this and includes class names in the [BEM Methodology][3] style (for a good overview read [MindBEMding - getting your head 'round BEM syntax][4]):</p> <p>```html</p> <nav class=scroll-nav> <div class=scroll-nav__wrapper> <span class=scroll-nav__heading> <ol class=scroll-nav__list> <li class=scroll-nav__item> <a class=scroll-nav__link> ``` An `active` class is attached to the nav item matching the section and sub-section that is the highest within the view bounds. An `in-view` class is attached to all nav items whose section or sub-section is within the view bounds. If you have short sections at the end of your page and dislike that the last nav itmes are never activated, you can use the `in-view` hook to style all sections with in the view. There are loading hooks added to the body element (similar to how Typekit handles font loading) to allow for css transitions or any other changes in css you'd need. When the plug-in starts `sn-loading` is added to the body class and is replaced by `sn-active` when the plugin is successful or `sn-failed` if it fails. ### Destroy scrollNav In addition to the initialization, there is now a destroy method available should you need it. To destroy scrollNav and remove all it's DOM changes use: ``` $('.post__article').scrollNav('destroy'); ``` ### Reset Positions on DOM Change There are a couple of ways you can reset scrollNav's positions when the DOM changes: #### Manually Simply call the `resetPos` method on your own: ``` $.fn.scrollNav('resetPos'); ``` #### Automatically Utilize [mutation observers][21] to call the `resetPos` method automatically: ``` var $; var observer_target = document.querySelector('.post__article'); var observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutations) { mutations.forEach(function() { $.fn.scrollNav('resetPos'); }); }); var observer_config = { attributes: true, childList: true, characterData: true, subtree: true }; observer.observe(observer_target, observer_config); ``` ## Default `options` There are a few customizable options in scrollNav using key : value pairs. These are the defaults. ``` $('.post-article').scrollNav({ sections: 'h2', subSections: false, sectionElem: 'section', className: 'scroll-nav', showHeadline: true, headlineText: 'Scroll To', showTopLink: true, topLinkText: 'Top', fixedMargin: 40, scrollOffset: 40, animated: true, speed: 500, insertTarget: this.selector, insertLocation: 'insertBefore', arrowKeys: false, scrollToHash: true, onInit: null, onRender: null, onDestroy: null }); ``` ### Sections As mentioned, the script automatically searches for `<h2>`s within the target article. If your page structure differs, feel free to target another selector, like an `<h3>` or `<h4>` or even a class, like `.scroll-headline`. ### Sub-Sections Set to `false` by default, the plugin supports nesting sub-sections within each section in the final nav. Available selectors are the same as Sections. ### Section Wrapper Element If your article already contains `section` tags, you'll want to change this to `'div'`. Sub-sections aren't affected by this option. ### Class Name If you want to change the default `scroll-nav` class naming used throughout (including in the BEM syntax for the child elems), you can do so by changing this value to your own. ### Show Headline Set this to `false` to remove the Headline Text entirely. ### Headline Text scrollNav's default title text is 'Scroll To', but feel free to modify it to whatever works for you, like 'Article Sections' or 'Page Navigation'. ### Show Top Link Set this to `false` to remove the Top Link nav item entirely. ### Top Link Text scrollNav's default return to the top link text is 'Top', but feel free to modify it to whatever works for you. ### Fixed Margin This is the `top` dimension you set for the `.scroll-nav.fixed` class, which is applied as the user scrolls down the page and is removed as they scroll above the article. You definitely want to set this if you don't use the default 40px, otherwise the nav will jump around as the user scrolls past the top of the article. ### Scroll Offset This option affects two things. First is the "active state" boundries within the viewport. The bounderies are within a distance from the top and bottom of the viewport equal to this amount. Second is the destination when animating the page scroll. This will place the heading of the section right at the top of the "active state" boundry. ### Animated Scrolling The plugin animates the page scroll when clicking on a nav link by default. Set this to `false` if you do not wish to animate the scroll. ### Scrolling Speed Change this to either increase or decrease the animated page scroll speed. ### Insertion Target If you need to insert the nav relative to an element other than the one scrollNav is initialized on, you can change it here. ### Insertion Location You can pass any of the following jQuery insertion methods to change where scrollNav is inserted in relation to the targeted container. `insertBefore`, `prependTo`, `appendTo`, or `insertAfter` ### Arrow Key Navigation Set this to `true` to allow up/down arrow keys to jump through each section. ### Scroll to hash Set this to false if you use hashed (http://example.com/#home) values for routing. ### Callback functions There are three new callback functions that you can utilize to accomodate anything you need to run after specific scrollNav events. They are `onInit`, `onRender`, and `onDestroy`. Add them to your options just like any other and they should look like this: ``` $('.post__article').scrollNav({ onInit: function() { callback actions in here } }); ``` ## Errors The plugin will refuse to build and log an error message if it doesn't find your desired container, the insertion target or any of the headlines specified within the container. If the nav doesn't show up on load, check your browser's console. ## Issues There are a few known issues, including poor location updating when scrolling on touch devices. If you find any others please submit them to [the issue tracker][5]. ## License scrollNav is Copyright &copy; 2012-2015 James Wilson, released under the [MIT license][6].
