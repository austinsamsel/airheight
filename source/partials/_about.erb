    <h1 class="light">Listen first</h1>
      <p>
        Are you looking to build a website that will pay off for your business? Or are you looking to create the most awesome app ever?
      </p>
      <p>My mantra is <strong class="highlight">listen first, then create</strong>. In order to create beautiful, useful digital products, it starts with listening for my client's real needs (and the needs of their audience). Together, we create solutions with measurable results. As we work together, thereâ€™s lots of feedback and each project's development is guided by our conversations. This is how we get it right.</p>
      <p>What's going on with your project? I'd love to share some ideas and see if I can help. <a href="hi@hightopsnyc.com">Let's chat</a>.</p>

        Hi! I'm Austin Samsel. I'm both a visual designer and a programmer. I believe empathy and connection are the driving forces for creating great work. Good things happen when we help others.
