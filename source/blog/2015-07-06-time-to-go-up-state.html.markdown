##Announcing Up State.

Up State means getting your website UP - the state of UP.

" *Up State.* "

Get it? Okay, cool.

So not only will I get your website up and running, but it's going to be a **high quality**, **mobile-responsive** website that I build in one week. There's no quotes, no haggling, no weirdness, just a flat-rate price of $999.

(fast inexpensive / high quality... image. w/ upstate in center...)

## So is this for me?

You're either 1 of 2 types of people:

1. You're a **small business owner** and you need a website to promote your business.
2. Or **You're a lead** at a company that is launching a new product, organizing a conference, or starting a new marketing campaign and you need to promote your product by giving it its own website.

At some point you've probably tried to:

* **$** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do-It-Yourself.
* **$ $ $** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hire a freelancer.
* **$ $ $ $ $**&nbsp; Hire an agency.

With results ranging from **WTF** to **meh** to **okay-we're-broke-now**.

## Seriously, though...

I got tired of making proposals and creating quotes when a bunch of my clients were asking for the same thing.

1. "A simple, good-looking website"
2. "Customized to reflect our business"
3. "That can make us money"

Up State is a flat-rate, streamlined, efficient service in response to that.

## What it is

All Up State websites are built on WordPress. WordPress is flexible, inexpensive, and you can grow your website in any direction you need (ecommerce, forms, etc.) while making use of a huge ecosystem of available software and support.
